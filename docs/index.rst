ReciprocalSpaceShip
===================

Tools for exploring reciprocal space.

``reciprocalspaceship`` provides a ``pandas``-style interface for
analyzing and manipulating reflection data from crystallography
experiments. Using this library, it is possible to interactively
work with crystallographic data in Python, enabling easy
integration with modern scientific computing libraries. ``reciprocalspaceship``
is intended to support the rapid prototyping of new crystallographic methods and
custom analyses while maintaining clear and performant code.

Features of this library include:

- ``pandas``-style objects, datatypes, and syntax that are familiar to python users.
- Built-in methods and support for the development of new functions that use space groups,
  unit cell parameters, and crystallographic symmetry operations.
- Support for reading and writing MTZ format reflection data.
