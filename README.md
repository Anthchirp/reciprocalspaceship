Tools for exploring reciprocal space

`reciprocalspaceship` provides a Pandas-style dataframe object for
analyzing and manipulating reflection data from crystallography
experiments.

## Getting Started 

We have some documentation, which can be viewed by cloning the repository.
Someday, we will have this hosted, but not today...

git clone https://github.com/Hekstra-Lab/reciprocalspaceship.git

```

Now, open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in the browser of your choice.

```
# Mac
